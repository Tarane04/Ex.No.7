# **Aim:**

To develop a **prompt-based application** using ChatGPT that organizes daily tasks and demonstrates how prompts evolve from simple to advanced formats, showcasing creativity, adaptability, and problem-solving skills using large language models.

---

# **AI Tools Required:**

* ChatGPT (Large Language Model)
* Any web browser
* (Optional) Simple interface: command-line/shell, chatbot UI, or form

---

# **Explanation:**

This experiment demonstrates how to use **prompt engineering** to create a **personal productivity assistant** using ChatGPT.
The assistant interacts in natural language and provides support for:

### **● Daily task management**

Accept, organize, and prioritize tasks.

### **● Smart scheduling**

Set reminders and identify free time or conflicts.

### **● Wellness suggestions**

Give daily wellbeing tips like hydration, breaks, and exercise.

### **● Adaptive responses**

Improve and modify suggestions based on user preferences (simulated memory).

The main prompt used for the application:

> **Prompt:**
> “Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries.
> The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time.”

This prompt allows the LLM to behave like a productivity assistant that can handle multiple types of user requests through simple text commands.

---

# **Procedure:**

### **1. Define Core Requirements**

Identify what features the assistant must have:

* Task creation and reminders
* Scheduling
* Wellness tips
* General question answering
* Ability to adapt to the user’s habits

---

### **2. Construct Prompts for Each Feature**

Develop individual prompts for each function:

1. **Daily Task Manager Prompt**

   * “Add a task: Buy groceries at 6 PM.”
   * “List all high-priority tasks for today.”

2. **Scheduler Prompt**

   * “Schedule a meeting tomorrow from 3–4 PM.”
   * “Do I have any free time on Friday?”

3. **Wellness Assistant Prompt**

   * “Give me one wellness tip for productivity.”
   * “Suggest a break routine during long study hours.”

4. **Adaptive Response Prompt**

   * “Remember that I prefer reminders 10 minutes before the event.” (Simulated)

---

### **3. Simulate User Interaction**

Use ChatGPT as a simple interface:

* User enters natural-language request
* Model responds with task lists, reminders, suggestions, etc.

Example:
User: “Remind me to drink water every 2 hours.”
Assistant: “Sure! I’ll remind you every 2 hours. Staying hydrated improves focus.”

---

### **4. Integrate Feedback (Simulated Memory)**

Ask the model to adapt:

* “I prefer short wellness tips.”
* “I like tasks sorted by time.”

LLM adjusts responses accordingly during the session.

---

### **5. (Optional) Build a Simple UI**

Use Python console, web form, or chatbot interface to simulate an app.

---

# **Expected Output (Example Output Produced by ChatGPT):**

### **Personal Productivity Assistant – Feature Overview**

---

## **1. Daily Task Manager**

✔ Accept tasks through natural language
✔ Set deadlines and priorities
✔ Give daily summary

**Example:**

* “Remind me to call mom at 6 PM.”
* “Add a high-priority task: Finish assignment.”

---

## **2. Smart Scheduler**

✔ Understands context
✔ Detects overlapping events
✔ Suggests free slots

**Example:**

* “You have a meeting from 10–11 AM. Your next free slot is 11–12 AM.”

---

## **3. Wellness Tips Generator**

✔ Offers hydration, posture, exercise, and break suggestions
✔ Adapts to user preferences

**Example:**

* “Take a 5-minute stretch break every hour.”
* “You prefer short tips — here’s today’s: Drink 1 glass of water now.”

---

## **4. General Query Assistant**

✔ Can answer basic questions:

* “What is photosynthesis?”
* “Give me a motivational quote.”

---

# **Result:**

The experiment successfully demonstrated how to develop a **prompt-based application** using a large language model.
Students learned to:

* Construct effective prompts for real-life applications
* Understand how LLMs can behave like personalized assistants
* Design interactive, user-friendly features
* Apply creativity to build custom AI tools
* Explore adaptive behaviour through preference-based prompting

This experiment showed the **practical utility of generative AI** in solving everyday problems through intelligent prompt design.
